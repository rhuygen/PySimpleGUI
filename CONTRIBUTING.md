#### Write Applications, Use PySimpleGUI, Write Tutorials, Teach Others

These are a few of the ways you can directly contribute to PySimpleGUI.  Using the package to make cool stuff and helping others learn how to use it to make cool stuff and a big help to PySimpleGUI.   **Everyone** learns from seeing other people's implementations.  It's through user's creating applications that new problems and needs are discovered.  These have had a profound and positive impact on the project in the past.

## Thank You

The support from the user community has been amazing.  Your passion for creating PySimpleGUI applications is infectious.  Every "thank you" is noticed and appreciated!  Your passion for wanting to see PySimpleGUI improve is neither ignored nor unappreciated.

It's understood that this way of development of a Python package is unorthodox.  You may find it frustrating and slow, but hope you can respect the decision for it to operate in this manner and be supportive.
