### Type of Issues (Enhancement, Error, Bug, Question)

### Operating System

### Python version

### PySimpleGUI Port and Version

This is critical to know.  Knowing where your PySimpleGUI.py file is located is just as important.  You can get these by adding this to the top of your file and running it:

```python
import PySimpleGUI as sg
print(sg)
print(sg.version)
```


### Your Experience Levels In Months or Years

_________ Python programming experience
_________ Programming experience overall
_________ Have used another Python GUI Framework (tkinter, Qt, etc) previously (yes/no is fine)?

### You have completed these steps:

- [ ] Read instructions on how to file an Issue
- [ ] Searched through main docs http://www.PySimpleGUI.org for your problem
- [ ] Searched through the readme for your specific port if not PySimpleGUI (Qt, WX, Remi)
- [ ] Looked for Demo Programs that are similar to your goal http://www.PySimpleGUI.com
- [ ] Note that there are also Demo Programs under each port on GitHub
- [ ] Run your program outside of your debugger (from a command line)
- [ ] Searched through Issues (open and closed) to see if already reported


### Description of Problem / Question / Details

### Code To Duplicate

A short program that isolates and demonstrates the problem (i.e. please don't paste a link to your 400 line program.... instead paste your 10 line program in full).  

Yes, it is a pain to narrow down problems, but it's part of the debugging process.  Help me help you by providing something that can be executed so that work on getting you a fix or a workaround can immediately begin.

This pre-formatted code block is all set for you to paste in your bit of code:

```python
import PySimpleGUI as sg
print(sg)
print(sg.version)
